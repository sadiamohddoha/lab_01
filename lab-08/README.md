1. CircleSizeSlider
   
 a. Which function changes the circle size?

 The circle’s size changes when the slider is moved. The slider has a listener that detects changes, and it updates the circle’s diameter in the panel. This happens inside the stateChanged method, which reads the slider value and tells the panel the new diameter.
b. When and how often does the circle redraw?

 Every time the slider is moved, the panel is repainted, so the circle redraws immediately on each change.
3. Random Programs

 a. Where does the random data come from?
 Both RandomHexPrinter and RawRandomHexStreamer get random bytes from the website random.org. The programs request data through the URL https://www.random.org/cgi-bin/randbyte.
 
b. Is the data truly random or pseudorandom?
 The randomness comes from atmospheric noise, so it’s closer to true randomness than the usual pseudorandom numbers generated by a computer program.

4. LogisticMapGenerator and Population Behavior
   
java LogisticMapGenerator 2.5 0.5 50 data.csv
a. Growth rates that lead to extinction:

 Values between 0 and 1 cause the population to eventually drop to zero.
b. Growth rates that lead to a stable population:

 Values between 1 and 3 make the population settle at a constant number over time.
c. Growth rates that lead to oscillations or chaos:

 Values above 3 first produce repeating cycles, and as r increases, the behavior becomes chaotic. Chaos starts around 3.56995, though there are still some repeating patterns inside the chaotic range.
 
6. Visualizing Programs and GUI
   
Programs like CSVtoPNG and GraphFromCSV take CSV data from the generators and turn it into graphs or animations. Adjusting things like axis margins, color, or how often points are plotted can make the results easier to read.
The BifurcationDiagram shows the long-term population for each growth rate r. It’s helpful to see when populations split into multiple stable values as r changes.
8. RabbitAgentSimulationEmergent
   
 a. What limits the rabbit population?
 The number of carrots each generation sets the limit. Rabbits can’t exceed what the resources support.
 
b. How is the carrot population maintained?
 Carrots are provided as a fixed amount each generation and reset every time.
 
c. How close is this to logistic map predictions?
 The simulation can behave like the logistic map on average, but exact results aren’t the same. Random events, discrete actions, and the way rabbits interact create differences, though the overall pattern is similar.
